We plan to make an account systems, where students can make normal accounts, allowing them to ask questions on a question board or do anything that would require an account.
We also plan to make an admin account for Mr. Swanson that would allow him to change the change the calendar or do anything that he would need to change on the website. A possible security concern is people possibly being able to get the passwords from a database, causing them to be hacked which is not good! We plan to add a security question so even if a password gets hacked, then the hacker can't access the account still.
