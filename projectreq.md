Project for APUSH teacher. Place to put study materials especially for APUSH test. Make a calendar where everything can be put down. Can make a place where people can ask questions to others or can ask teacher on a question board. This allows everyone to see the question and answer. Make a quiz for each chapter. Make a timeline game with presidents and what happened.

Mr. Swanson doesn't have too great of a calendar, with it being pretty basic and only showing what is happening that week. We can fix that with a better calendar. Also, the only convenient way to really ask questions is to do it in class. The question board we plan to make will allow people to ask questions whenever.
